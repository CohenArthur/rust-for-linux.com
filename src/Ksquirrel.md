# Ksquirrel

[Ksquirrel](https://github.com/ksquirrel) was a GitHub bot that helped newcomers to the kernel get accustomed to the kernel requirements for submissions (e.g. checking that commit messages were properly signed and formatted). It was also useful as a double-check for maintainers that they did not forget to check those requirements.

We may bring it back for mailing list submissions!
