> Samsung is actively engaged in supporting the integration of Rust code into the
> Linux Kernel. Recognizing the significant benefits that Rust brings to kernel
> and system software development, particularly in terms of enhancing security and
> reducing critical bugs, Samsung is committed to enabling kernel developers to
> write block layer device drivers using the Rust programming language. By
> embracing modern programming languages like Rust, Samsung aims to attract new
> talent to systems development and promote memory safety within the Linux storage
> stack.

> “Google supports and contributes directly to the Rust for Linux project. Our Android team is evaluating a new Binder implementation and considering other drivers where Rust could be adopted.”

> “Arm recognises the Rust value proposition and is actively working with the Rust community to improve Rust for Arm based systems.
A good example is Arm’s RFC contribution to the Rust language which made Linux on 64-bit Arm systems a Tier-1 Rust supported platform.
>
> Rustaceans at Arm are excited about the Rust for Linux initiative and look forward to assisting in this effort.”

> “Microsoft's Linux Systems Group is interested in contributing to getting Rust into Linux kernel. Hopefully we will be able to submit select Hyper-V drivers written in Rust in the coming months.”

> “There is interest in using Rust for kernel work that Red Hat is considering.”

— [Red Hat](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20211206140313.5653-1-ojeda@kernel.org/), 2021-07-08.


> “Rust for Linux is a key step towards reducing security-critical kernel bugs, and on the path towards our ultimate goal of making Linux free of security-critical bugs. We are using Rust in our OS research, and adoption is easier with an existing Rust in the Linux kernel framework in place.”

— Thomas Anderson, University of Washington, 2022-06-23.


> “We are convinced that Rust is changing the landscape of system programming by applying the research done on programming languages in the last decades. We wanted to see how the language was able to help us write code we are really comfortable with thanks to the extensive static checking.”

— Esteban Blanc, Arthur Cohen and Martin Schmidt, LSE (Systems Research Laboratory) at EPITA (École pour l'informatique et les techniques avancées), 2022-06-23.


> “Being able to use Rust in the Linux kernel is an incredible milestone on the road to a more secure future for the Internet and everything else that depends heavily on Linux.”

— [ISRG's Prossimo Project](https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/rust-in-linux-just-the-beginning/), 2022-10-18.
