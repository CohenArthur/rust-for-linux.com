# NVMe driver

The Rust [NVMe driver](https://github.com/metaspace/linux/tree/nvme) is an effort to implement a PCI NVMe driver in safe Rust for use in the Linux Kernel. The purpose of the driver is to provide a vehicle for development of safe Rust abstractions and to prove feasibility of Rust as an implementation language for high performance device drivers.

The Rust NVMe driver was originally authored by Wedson Almeida Filho and is now maintained by Andreas Hindborg (Samsung).
